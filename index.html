                    <b>Chris</b> always enjoyed playing guitar which in the end got him playing
                    concerts all over Ireland. He began playing on an accoustic
                    guitar when he was 7 years old and followed
                    his passion for music in secondary school where
                    he attended a music club where he met his three best friends.
                    Chris easily managed to convince his friends to start their own band
                    and spent their weekends together practicing

                    <b>Sean</b> spent most of his days helping his dad around their farm and
                    never was the type of person to have his life planned out ahead
                    of time so it definitly was a surprise
                    when he told his family that he was leaving the farm to go chase
                    his new found dream of playing in a rock band. Sean knew that he
                    couldn't spend all his life working on
                    a farm and so he reached for the stars

                    <b>Steven</b> took a great liking to music when he was attending secondary
                    school. When he first joined the music club he felt bored of constantly
                    playing the tin whistle or
                    the cow bell but when he met Chris and tried playing on an electric
                    guitar his whole perspective on music changed. After many years
                    of practicing he felt like he had
                    mastered the electric guitar and he was ready to be a rock star

                    <b>Liam</b> had two hobbies, fixing up his old broken down car and playing the
                    drums. For him nothing could beat the feeling of a wrench in one
                    hand and beer in the other.
                    He only had two options in life, be a mechanic or a
                    rock star. Fortunately his friends convinced him to join their
                    brand new band they named "The Blades" and Liam
                    has absolutely no regrets
